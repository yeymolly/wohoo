   <center> <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Allen Marx C. Monilar, and I hail from the vibrant city of Las Pi√±as. <br>
        One of my greatest passions lies in playing card games, particularly the intricate world of Magic: The Gathering. I find myself drawn to collecting these cards, whether it be for their captivating artwork or the strategic power they possess within the game. <br>
        When I venture outside, I often indulge in sketching, capturing moments and scenes that inspire me during outings or strolls around the neighborhood. <br>
        Additionally, I derive immense joy from the art of baking desserts and crafting culinary delights. The process of creating and savoring these dishes brings me a sense of fulfillment and creativity that complements my other interests beautifully. </p>
